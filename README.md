# Deep Learning Papers on Medical Image Analysis

## Background
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first list of deep learning papers on medical applications. There are couple of lists for deep learning papers in general, or computer vision, for example [Awesome Deep Learning Papers](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers.git). In this list, I try to classify the papers based on their deep learning techniques and learning methodology. I believe this list could be a good starting point for DL researchers on Medical Applications. 

## Criteria

1. A list of **top deep learning papers** published since 2016.
2. Papers are collected from peer-reviewed journals and high reputed conferences. 
3. Additional keywords are required for any paper mainly the image modality and medical area, for example (X-ray, Tuberculosis). 

*List of Journals and Conferences:*

- **[Medical Image Analysis (MedIA)](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/medical-image-analysis/)**
- **[IEEE Transaction on Medical Imaging (IEEE-TMI)](https://ieee-tmi.org/)**
- **[IEEE Transaction on Biomedical Engineering (IEEE-TBME)](http://tbme.embs.org/)**
- **[IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (IEEE-JBHI)](http://jbhi.embs.org/)**
- **[International Journal on Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery (IJCARS)](http://www.springer.com/medicine/radiology/journal/11548)**
- **International Conference on Information Processing in Medical Imaging (IPMI)**
- **International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI)**
- **International Conference on Information Processing in Computer-Assisted Interventions (IPCAI)**
- **IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)**
