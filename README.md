# Deep Learning Papers on Medical Image Analysis

## Background
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first list of deep learning papers on medical applications. There are couple of lists for deep learning papers in general, or computer vision, for example [Awesome Deep Learning Papers](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers.git). In this list, I try to classify the papers based on their deep learning techniques and learning methodology. I believe this list could be a good starting point for DL researchers on Medical Applications. 

## Criteria

1. A list of **top deep learning papers** published since 2016.
2. Papers are collected from peer-reviewed journals and high reputed conferences. 
3. A list will be ordered based on the number of citations.
