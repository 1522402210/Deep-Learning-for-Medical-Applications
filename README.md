Deep Learning Papers on Medical Image Analysis

## Background
This is the first list of deep learning papers on medical applications. There are couple of lists for deep learning papers in general, or computer vision, for example [Awesome Deep Learning Papers](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers.git). In this list, I try to classify the papers based on their deep learning architecture and learning methodology. I beleive this list could be a good starting point for DL researchers on Medical Applications. 

## Criteria

1. A list of **top deep learning papers** published since 2016.
2. Papers are collected from peer-reviewd journals and high reputed conferences. 
3. A list will be oredered based on the number of citations.

*(Journals and Conferences)*
- **Medical Image Analysis (MedIA)**
- **IEEE Transaction on Medical Imaging (IEEE-TMI)**
- **IEEE Transaction on Biomedical Engineering (IEEE-TBME)**
- **IEEE Transaction on Health Informatics
- **International Journal on Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery (IJCARS)**
